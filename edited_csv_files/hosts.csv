A passionate traveller and entrepreneur, I’m originally from France and now living between Canada, Mexico and France with my wife and two beautiful daughters.

I enjoy meeting new people and exploring new cultures. I’ve been to Thailand, Myanmar, Indonesia, Spain, Italy, Greece, Belgium, Portugal, Sweden, Finland, UK, Holland, Switzerland, Caraibian, Hong Kong, Australia, USA, Mexico…and there’s more on the bucket list.

I’m happiest when I’m outside; swimming, kiteboarding, running, hiking, wakeboarding and snowboarding. I’m also a big fan of design and architecture.

I was one of the earliest members of AirBnB (2009) and the first person to rent a house-boat 

My philosophy? Dream your life and live your dream!

The city + ocean walks, the cultural offerings, the great restaurants for all tastes + budgets with cuisine from all over the world, the cafes with live music, the spirit of the 'sharing economy', the beautiful parks, like QUEEN ELIZABETH PARK + STANLEY PARK, and many smaller community parks,  the BLOEDEL Conservatory,  VAN DUSEN GARDENS,  the LYNN CANYON SUSPENSION BRIDGE,  the VANCOUVER ART GALLERY, the MUSEUM of ANTHROPOLOGY at the UBC campus, etc., etc., ........ 
and I would be happy to introduce visitors to its many different aspects, and answer any questions you may have.

I truly enjoy helping fellow travellers feel at home by providing 
comfortable surroundings, a relaxed, easy-going atmosphere,

with FINDING PERMANENT HOUSING  in Vancouver, if you are new to the CITY and/or the COUNTRY, and if you plan to GET SETTLED here  ........
plus answering your QUESTIONS + fulfill reasonable REQUESTS to the best of my ability.

Besides travelling all over the world, and my passion for Canada, for Vancouver, Vancouver Island, the Sunshine Coast + other areas of British Columbia, some of my other interests are: 

Neuroscience, depression research + treatment (especially the newer theories), as well as other treatment-resistant health conditions that science + medicine do not yet have good answers for, 
brain research, psychology, neurology, evidence-based medicine, injury recovery, concussion recovery //

Healthy nutrition without being too dogmatic about it //
Photography, architecture, design + industrial design, beautiful things //

Entrepreneurship + philanthropy, the 'Sharing Economy', ' (Website hidden by Airbnb) treating each other with kindness + respect,  interesting + novel ways of creating a good, meaningful life as well as a good income by thinking outside of the box // 

Reading, biographies, novels, short stories, science, history, politics, great TV shows + films, geography, 
different musical styles ...... especially songs with interesting, intelligent lyrics one can actually understand, 
great writing + intelligent conversation, small dinners with good friends (old + new) //

Downhill skiing, ocean kayaking, canoeing, bicycling, swimming (ideally in tropical waters), other forms of physical activities, like walks with great views on beaches, rocky headlands, most islands (tropical + otherwise), houses with ocean views ...... and probably a few more things that I can't think of right now ...... but this list should give you a pretty good idea of what constitutes a good day for me.

I used to design and build costumes for theatre, film and TV but now I mainly make sculptural stuff and paint quite a bit but also do a little photography. My name is rare. If you look me up, you will find me fairly fast.

My husband Erez and I are fiftysomethings and have no kids but are fine with it if you do. We inherited 4 giant dogs from my dad who lived in the desert but are down to one since they were old guys when we got them. That sure changed our lives. I know I could never handle the responsibility of kids.


We split our time between California and Canada and can often be found on the I-5 in a big white cargo van  hauling many dog beds and dogs.

We are total podcast nerds and also like a good audiobook. We listened to The Life of Pi on one of our trips with the four dogs and felt very much like we were a boat full of critters that had to somehow learn how to travel together. 

Some podcasts we like are Benjamin Walker's Theory of Everything, 99% Invisible , Planet Money, Selected Shorts, This American Life, Radiolab, Future Tense, Science Friday, Wiretap, Singularity 1 on 1, Serial, Startup etc etc.

When we aren't listening to podcasts we can usually be found on reddit  so we are pretty quiet tenants.
When we travel it's important that there is a dog park nearby (if we have the vermin along) and otherwise, a solid internet connection is the only must.

The studio I'm listing here is my actual art studio but we also use it as a guest house. It used to be a garage. There is a bit of space to lay down fold out foamies as an additional bed but there isn't a living room area or a sofa. There also is not a kitchen but a kitchenette- only a two burner electric cooktop, coffee maker, coffee grinder, microwave, toaster oven,kettle,  apartment fridge and a giant restaurant sink (in case you need to dye anything while you are here ; ) There are various tools taking up space (eg: drafting table,industrial sewing machine) but there is a small table and a few office chairs. The main space is taken up with a very tall 8' x 4' work table. Anyone that wants to create stuff  is in luck. Just ask and I may be able to supply whatever tools or materials you need too.

Thinking that this didn't sound very comfortable, we decided to open our home to visitors.  We discovered that we love to share our spectacular city, but also that our guests allow us to see our city from a new perspective.  We are constantly learning new things about Vancouver, and about the world through our international (and sometimes not-so-distant) visitors.  When the Olympics ended we decided to keep the spirit of hospitality going.

Kevin is a Marine Biologist, originally from Florida, who consults at the Vancouver Aquarium and also runs his own custom aquarium and maintenance business.  Usually in flip-flops, even in the winter, Kevin brings a sunny disposition from the warm south to Vancouver.  Kevin likes to balance adventure with relaxation, and to experience both urban and natural settings,  getting to know new places through their people, their food, and if possible, through diving! Favourite vacation spots for Kevin: Australian Outback, Great Barrier Reef, Franz Joseph Glacier in New Zealand, Seoraksan National Park in Korea, New York City, Kyoto.  His favourite spot to dive was the Whitsundays in Australia.

Patrick is an associate at a small, recognized architecture firm in Vancouver, where he keeps busy and loves his work.  Originally from Victoria, BC, on Vancouver Island, home is where the mountains meet the ocean.  Patrick is crazy about architecture and loves to learn about new places through their historical buildings.  The perfect vacation for Patrick fuses culture and relaxation. Favourite vacation spots for Patrick: Kyoto and Nara, the Meteora in Greece, Crete, Rome (the whole city, but especially the Pantheon), the baths at Caracalla in Italy, Venice, New York, the Oregon dunes, coastal California, Montreal, and anywhere in British Columbia where nature is unspoiled.

  I was born and raised in  ( East ) Vancouver, BC and  have worked and travelled all over Canada coast to coast, drove the west coastline from Vancouver to Guatemala, seen quite a bit of  USA, Borneo, Malaysia. The past few years I focussed on Great Britain, Eastern and western Europe, Turkey where I walked extensively in no particular direction  or destination, pretty much making it up as I went along , observing whatever crossed my path on that day .

We like to travel and stay with the hosts to be able to meet new people, listen to their experiences and benefit from their recommendations or in apartments or independent houses (so that we can do our shopping and enjoy the food of the region where we stay. )). My husband is an amazing cook and gets inspired when he is on vacation: D

I recently started managing my mom's house for Airbnb reservations. If her house is available, it is most likely because she is with us in Canada, taking advantage of her grandchildren.
Her house (mine too, in a way) is the most comfortable and has everything to please. The villa is very well located and there is so much to discover in the south of France at any time of the year. I miss it a lot. I hope you will have the opportunity to experience it.
She has just installed a SPA and has designated a pretty garden around.

If not in Vancouver,  we are at my second home on Salt Spring Island right by the ocean in the quiet north east part of the island. I feel lucky to have found this gem. Truly  a piece of paradise.


 In Vancouver,  we live in one of those beautiful 100 +  years old Kitsilano Craftsman houses. I have lived in Kitsilano for over 20 years.  It has always been a great place to live as a single adult and also as a parent with kids. It is a very convenient  location for both living and visiting. No car needed as restaurants, cafes, small shops and much more are so close by and public transportation is around the corner. Also for kids, there are always many activities and parks close by.  

My daughters are, one  16 years old & the other 10 years old .. and I am an Expressive Arts Therapist, Interior Stylist, dance & movement enthusiast & a mom with many projects going on! We speak  3 languages at home English, Arabic & French so don't worry about communication if English is not your first language :)  

We love people & also music!  We play when we have the chance, so if you are a musician go ahead and play .. let us know if you want to jam! :)

Professionally I work with youth ages 11 - 18 and have done so for over 25 years. James manages a local Indigenous tourism company and is a canoe guide (outdoor/adventure guiding).

We love to spend time travelling different places of the world and endeavour to understand the places we visit in a more meaningful way by meeting up with local people and experiencing life in these locations beyond the usual tourist track.

We have loved making new friends from all over the world and hope to do more of this, now by also hosting in our home in beautiful Vancouver, British Columbia.

Tuba comes from Istanbul, Turkey, where she earned a degree in electrical and electronic engineering before being drawn to Vancouver’s digital visual effects industry. She worked at ILM and her recent credits include Ready Player One, A Wrinkle in Time, Skyscraper, Aquaman and recently  released Aladdin. She is currently working at Apple in Los Angeles. Ollie was born in Auckland, NZ, and got into the visual effects industry in his home country, choreographing virtual battle scenes on the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Since then he’s lived in such diverse cities as Tokyo, London, Munich and Havana. He only came to Vancouver to work on one film, but quickly fell in love with the city—and one of its inhabitants, in particular.

Because we’re a Kiwi and a Turkey, we jokingly call ourselves the “two flightless birds”. But flying is our favourite way to get places, with sailing a close second.

An independent person living in downtown Vancouver who is outgoing and open minded. I'm very goal oriented, committed to my career, personal goals, family and friendships, I am always enjoying life and thrive on great times with the amazing people I surround myself with.

Although my career is my main focus I am always up for new and exciting adventures and would most likely try anything once...I guess you could say I'm a bit of a thrill seeker.   As an example, I went white water rafting last Summer and although you might not think that's scary try to imagine doing it as a person who doesn't know how to swim....I jumped off a cliff with a life-jacket on and still almost got washed away... Needless to say I survived and am now entertaining swimming lessons because of my love for being around water.

I have a busy social life outside work, but also enjoy quiet nights at home be it experimenting with cooking new cuisine, watching movies or simply enjoying music of which I enjoy all types.  I would say I'm a person of extremes, days off are often spent outdoors and staying active....after all Vancouver is incredibly versatile, an adult playground if you will.  There aren't many other cities I know of where you can hike and snowboard in the same day if you choose which is why I love living here.  I enjoy learning about different cultures and travelling which I have done a fair bit of and intend to (Website hidden by Airbnb) current bucket list includes Italy, Turkey and Greece. I am a participant in Philanthropy, a strong believer in humanity, I am committed to donating to local charities be it time or recourses and I have also been sponsoring a 10 year old boy from Laos now for 3 years. Watching him grow and learn, knowing I have made his life just a tiny bit easier has been an incredible journey in itself for me.

My life motto is ""Balance"" and I believe you always have to smile more than you cry, give more than what you take, and love more than you hate.

As a host, I'd like to make my guests feel as comfortable as they would at home and I believe It's the little things that matter. In return, I hope my guests would treat my place as good as they would their own home.

We took our first separate vacation(s) in (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) ; I took our daughters then aged 16 and 19 to NYC staying in our first airbnb in the Lower East Side.  He went on a cycling vacation with friends to Tucson, Arizona.  For 18 years we spent two weeks in the summer cycling as a family in Whistler, renting the same cabin (pre-airbnb)and for the past 14 years Christian and I have made an annual pilgrimage in June to Yellow Point Lodge on Vancouver Island, which is a summer camp for adults (no children or pets allowed, and NO internet reception!) At YPL we practise the triathlon of eat/read/sleep/repeat interspersed with cycling the country roads, kayaking, using the tree shower on warm days, and exploring the forest. 

Our most recent airbnb stays were in (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) in Marseille, the Dordogne, and Brittany. Local bread, cheese, wine, foie gras, oysters and other shellfish = epicureal bliss.

My dream is to run a B&B in France (or the Okanagan), where Christian could organize cycling tours for people who love food and drink as much as we do. 

The novel I most enjoyed recently was All the Light We Cannot See.  I love NYC for the Brooklyn Bridge, the Staten Island ferry, TKTS, the museums, LES,the Tenement Museum,Magnolia Bakery. I love Portland for its food, craft beer, bike routes, parks, and Powell's Books. I love Seattle for its Zoo, Science Centre, SAM, Dale Chiuly (OK, Tacoma) great restaurants and great selection of wine and beer - my favourite weekend getaway, except for the exorbitant cost of parking downtown.  I love my neighbourhood of Riley Park, just off Main St. I am hooked on Netflix.

I love traveling to meet people and discover other cultures. I love reading, learning new things, sharing different views, trying out new food; when it's the unknown I like it.

I'm passionate about movies, photography and storytelling. I worked in diverse countries to pursue my dream jobs and now traveling to create videos on my own.

Me as a guest: I try not to disturb and be respectful to the people I encounter. While I'm not a materialistic person I'm highly caring to the things I have and that people would lend to me. A scratch on my camera lens would drive me crazy and I'm the same for about everything.

I have lived in Vancouver on and off for nearly 10 years, with one extended leave for university.  My heart lives in this city and so as soon as I was able to move back, I did, and have made this my home ever since.  My boyfriend Emmet and I share a beautiful one bedroom apartment in downtown Vancouver.  We both love to travel and are constantly planning our next adventure.  He is originally from Europe and we have often travel to visit his family and branched off to explore other areas of the continent from their home base.  Having lived out of suitcases on these trips, we know what it is like to be away from the comforts of home.

We like to keep things pretty minimalistic and that is reflected in our apartment - a beautiful, simple home.  We love to explore the world and our home city of Vancouver and can provide you with tips on what to see during your stay here.  

In my own travels I have both rented out my previous apartment and also rented accommodation in other cities, mostly using more primitive tools like (Hidden by Airbnb) to make this happen. Hurray for the emergence of Airbnb!

Last summer, Emmet and I went to Toronto and had a fantastic experience with an Airbnb there.  We really got a sense of what day-to-day life is like in the city. Right away I knew that I wanted to share our apartment to give others the opportunity to explore Vancouver like true Vancouverites.

So here we are with our bright and cozy home that we open to visitors when we are head off to travel.  We keep most of the basics stocked as we know what it is like to have to fit and carry things in your suitcase or go without. It is our goal to make you as comfortable in our home as you are in yours.  If you have any special requests or needs or just want more information, please don't hesitate to ask.

Happy travels and we hope to hear from you!",N/A,N/A,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/ee95f47d-6b19-4393-8378-d255dcf18803.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/ee95f47d-6b19-4393-8378-d255dcf18803.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,West End,1,1

Beyond being a host I am an avid Airbnb guest, visiting 50+ awesome airbnbs over the years. I’ve been very fortunate to meet some great hosts turned friends along the way and can’t wait to meet more! 

Fav place I’ve visited: Malta 
Fav BC Airbnb to visit: Suite on the Velvet in Gibsons, BC 
Fav spot in Vancouver: Tie between English Bay and Granville Island 
Fav part of airbnb: giving/getting tips to live like a local! 

Goal as a host: sharing my personal home and hosting long stays (30 day +) in beautiful Vancouver and giving guests a true home away from home! 

Goal as co-host: Providing guests a great experience in beautiful spaces! 

Goal as a guest: always leave the place as good as I find it and make it a breeze for my host! 

Last destination: Laos, Cambodia and Thailand  

Next destination: Europe and (hopefully) South America in 2023

I have a good grasp of the transit system, tourist attractions, dining and night life, as well as some key Vancouver treasures that might not be in your travel books.

I spent my early adulthood in marine school and working on ships. I then dedicated years at the university in the medical/healthcare field. In parallel to my academic studies, I also attended culinary school and worked in many restaurants.

I spend most of my spare time with my girlfriend, friends and family. I travel often, exercise rigorously and play multiple sports. I volunteer as a ski patrol and a snowboard instructor, play and listen to music, and do recreational flying.

More than anything in life I value social relationships, whether with friends, family, relatives or romantic partners.

If you come to Vancouver and I don't get the opportunity to host you, make sure you still contact me. I would be glad to meet and greet you, show you my amazing city and introduce you to a few friends - I have a diverse group of.

We’re Ana & Alberto. We have been living in Vancouver for a little over 9 years and we can’t imagine our lives without this amazing city, with a lot of great things to do all year long. 

There are so many things we love to do here, some of our favourites include  biking, skiing, boating and enjoying the variety of food & drink options with our dear friends. 

We have been travelling with Airbnb and it is always the greatest experience to be able to enjoy new places and at the same time feeling like home, so we decided to share our home with travellers who are seeking something special, modern with amazing downtown views. 

We hope you enjoy spending time at our place as much we enjoy setting it up and decorating it for you!

I am excited to become member of Airbnb! Can’t wait to host people from all over the world!!!

Initially, I came here for education. I graduated from UBC International relations Program. Now, Vancouver is my second hometown. I have lived here nearly 10years. During my stay, I totally fell in love with Vancouver, and also met my current husband… I am sure you will also have a wonderful memory here that never forget. 

You will live in a safe, comfortable and clean apartment located right at the HEART of Downtown Vancouver. Great for people who love SHOPPING since we are right across Pacific Centre and Holt Renfrew Mall. Few steps away from restaurants, shops, art gallery, museum, sightseeings. 

Easy access to Transit system(Bus, Skytrain, Sea Bus). Granville Skytrain Station is accessible from our building elevator by security FOB(Tenants ONLY). You really don’t need a car, but we offer a secured parking spot too. 

Feel free to contact me with any questions. I will do my best to help during your stay. 

Hope to see you soon!

My space is neat,  well kept, impeccably clean and I absolutely love my home and do my best to keep it beautiful to be a comfortable home and abode for all my guests. Quiet, privacy and comfort is always a guarantee when you stay with us.
 I enjoy gardening and have a lot of fun tending my beautiful and vibrant dahlias in the spring and summer months and up until the fall. I love travelling to beautiful diving destinations and trekking/hiking, both in Europe, South America and Asia, One of my best tropical diving experiences so far has been the endless white sands in the Philippines in numerous places that feels like paradise, inTahiti, the Caribbean in BVI and Hawaii, Cabo San Lucas and Puerto Vallarta also fairs well. 
Running marathon in international destinations is another way to thoroughly enjoy my travel. I love trail running the rockies of Colorado, Wyoming and our very own local mountains in the Northshore and the rugged interior of Nelson, Golden, Rossland and Whistler  here in British Columbia where we ski when the powder abounds. 
I know the city well and will help our future guests if required or refer you to an experienced tour guide.
My home is close to the water,  accessible to safe running and strolling in Kitsilano neighbourhood where trails are close by, downtown shopping is only 10-15 minutes drive or by public transit.
I enjoy listening to classical and jazz and  passionate about cooking, travelling to diving destinations,  including marathoning to international destinations as my way of enjoying a healthy, happy and active lifestyle.
I have a dog who's name is Oreo, who will greet you at the doorstep!
I hope to share my  home to respectful guests and travellers far and wide, who appreciate a good home away from home.

I am an award winning artist, creativity coach and workshop facilitator. I use my curiosity, imagination and creativity combined with love, compassion and listening to shape my own work, as well as guide participants in my creative coaching programs.

Originally from Israel, my creative journey took me to live and work in many different placed: fine arts in California and Boston, apprenticed in the art of flower design in New York City, and worked in both fashion and flower design in various cities in Europe. In the early nineties, I was selected to work and design alongside the renowned Mitzi Lorentz in London, UK.

It was when I moved to Amsterdam in 1994 that I found my passion for jewellery design. While there, I was privileged to learn from various master jewelers from around Europe, the US and, more recently, Canada.

I now live and work in Vancouver, Canada and I'm delighted and proud to say my work has been featured in many exhibitions throughout Canada and the US. One of my career highlights was being part of the ""Unity and Diversity"" exhibition for the Olympics in Vancouver Canada.",N/A,N/A,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/657e3665-0067-45ff-9043-e9f2f72e88fe.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/657e3665-0067-45ff-9043-e9f2f72e88fe.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,,1,2

Things I like:
* 5 things I can't live without are my husband, my son, my yoga mat, my snowboard, and living near the beach, mountains, and rainforest (how lucky am I?I)
* I love to travel and will go anywhere - I want to see all that the world has to offer!
* I am a voracious reader and a good book is an essential part of my travels!
* I am not a ""movie buff"" by any means, but when I do need a relaxing night on the couch, anything with Leonardo DiCaprio will do!
* My favourite shows are Game of Thrones, anything on the Food Network, with reality shows being my guilty pleasure!
* I love having a bit of background music for everything I do!
* I am obsessed with food (cooking and eating), and experiencing local cuisine is my favourite aspect of travelling!

My style of travelling is to ""live like a local"". I am clean, quiet, and respectful. I will treat your home as if it is my own.

In turn, I also I want my guests to ""live like locals"", and will leave all of my favourite comforts such as coffee and a bottle of wine or two!

My life motto is to live with a passion that inspires the mind, body, and soul.",N/A,100%,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/0522d1d4-cd1b-4c6e-9415-e93443ef07a6.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/0522d1d4-cd1b-4c6e-9415-e93443ef07a6.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,Kitsilano,1,3

I was a high school, elementary school, adult continued education and college teacher for most of my life. I also worked as a licensed real estate broker, financial advisor and an orthodontist assistant.

 I love animals, nature and traveling and have been to many places in every major continent. My goal is visiting, learning and admiring as many places, customs and cultures as I can . I'll help you as much as you need but will not be intrusive to your privacy unless you ask for help when you are here. I am really looking forward to welcome you and serve you with my best abilities. 

I really love this side job, it provides me endless chances to meet wonderful people from all over the world. it's the best venue to understand,  feel and learn about other countries' without ever walking out of my door !  it's very satisfying and rewarding experience for me albeit every once in awhile, there are some guests could not be satisfied and even think of quiting. Seeing over 75% previous guests writing 5 Star reviews for me and keep me as a Super Host for over 5 times in a row is the best motivation for me to keep doing it. it's so heart warming whenever read new reviews thanking me for providing one of the best or the Best Airbnb experiences. I've got the most wonderful job on Earth! 

I set the price very reasonably that most people could afford to come visiting this beautiful city I call home. I have been living in Vancouver for over 30 years and I fell in love with her since I first laid my eyes on Her . Hope you'll love Vancouver and feel comfortable in my home as much as I do and have a great time here. Thank you so much again for choosing to be my guests!

I'm passionate about making my Airbnb space as cozy and enjoyable as possible so that guests can feel like they're on vacation even if they're just in town for a weekend. 

I take good care of my place and try to pay attention to every detail, so that it feels like more than just an ordinary Airbnb space - but more like a true home away from home.

We would love to offer suggestions to you about what to do in Vancouver when it comes to sports from being on the water to being on a mountain. And the best thing about a sporting adventure is the apres beer and appetizers at a pub:)

I love gardening and my skills are good with flowers but I am struggling being successful with vegetables:(

We both enjoy road trips and have done a lot around BC, Alberta and into the US (Washington, Oregon and California). On our travel abroad list for 2017 is Ireland and England.....and maybe Scotland, perhaps.

I have lots of suggestions for funky restaurants, that aren't main stream restaurants. My favourites are in Gastown and Main Street.

John and I are looking forward to meeting our guests.

There are few regions of this incredible province that I have not explored through my work. 
I also spent a good deal of my 20’s travelling the world for work and pleasure- India, Africa, Central America, South East Asian and more. Those travels reinforced the importance of positive engagement with local cultures and communities and that with mutual respect, support and openness both parties can benefit and thrive. 
Since having children my international travels have been less frequent. However, both my partner and I work in the field and often do work or leisure related trips throughout the province. We have put a great deal of love and care into our home and are happy to open up our space to guests and new-comers to Vancouver while we are away.

My name is Jamie and I’m a father of two boys. I have been living in Vancouver for over 20 years and in this home for over 10 years. There is no other location in Vancouver, where you would want to live or stay. This beautiful property is in the heart of Vancouver’s Westside, near Kitsilano, Kerrisdale, Jericho beach, UBC & downtown.

We love to host and meet new friends from around the world. I am very passionate about Vancouver and living in the most beautiful part of Canada.

This house was just finished fully renovated  to meet all your expectations and help make it feel like you are in a comfortable home, away from home. You will not find a better home to stay in, that will meet all your needs. It's ideal for every small or large group, that's looking to relax, have a family gathering or a business retreat.

Vancouver was the Host the 2010 Olympic Winter Game and this property was  honoured to host a large corporate sponsor and their sponsored Olympic Athletes, Top executive and their family and friends from around the world. Since then...Vancouver has become one of the worlds number one destinations to live or visit. It is such an alive beautiful city and has so much to offer and keep you entertained, throughout the entire stay, anytime of the year. You can actually ski/snowboard, play golf and have a picnic at the beach... ALL on the same day!

If you have transportation, there’s even more beautiful sites to visit in all four directions… outside of Vancouver.

North of Vancouver: 
Whistler/Blackcomb. World class skiing/boarding, mountain biking, golf courses, tennis, hiking....and much more. 

East of Vancouver:
Okanagan Valley. World class wineries and golf courses. 

West of Vancouver: 
The Gulf Islands. One of the worlds most scenic areas for Sailing/Boating/Whale watching and simply relaxing.

South of Vancouver: 
The Beautiful West Coast of the Untied States. (Washington State, Oregon State & California)

It is by far the most Beautiful Destination in the World and this  house has been completely renovated to help make your stay ... Perfect!

Hello! I grew up in Vancouver and like so many of us I love to travel. I love meeting new people and finding out just how small this world is! 

I caught the travel bug in the last 6 years and I've stayed in all sorts of accommodations. I look for safety, security, cleanliness, comfort
and a friendly host when I choose my
destinations.

I feel very strongly about maintaining the same standards and a hospitable environment for travellers staying.

Amongst the group you will find a love of gardening, drawing, traveling, food (ask us about our favourite spots!) manga, reading, tinkering, cycling, walking, thrift shops, and general making of stuff. We can all safely say we have too many hobbies and don't slow down enough.
 
Tim and I, as architects and heritage aficionados, have spent the last 7+ years restoring our 1912 home while constructing a new carriage house at the back of the property for my parents. It continues to be a labour of love and a work in progress.

We’re seasoned Airbnb travelers, and are excited that our children are finally old enough to enjoy traveling as much as we do.  We hope to make our way to San Francisco when things become safe to do so. When we're traveling or my parents are off on adventures, our respectives homes become available for others to experience our great city.

For guests, we aim to find the right balance of being responsive to your needs, while also respecting your privacy during your stay.  We love our neighbourhood, feel lucky to live here, and look forward to sharing it with you!

I was raised in very small town where I learned early on, the importance of relationships and community, and I have carried this focus with me throughout my life.  My true passion is to make the lives around me better, whether by being a support system for my family, volunteering regularly at the local Homeless Shelter or by providing true service and value to my Real Estate clients. Making others happy is what makes me happy... that... and organizing. I love to structure and organize pretty much anything! 

When I'm not working or spending quality time with my family at the ski hill, soccer fields, or baseball fields (we have two very active teenagers who keep us busy),  I'm often found in the gym, on my mountain bike, reading, playing the piano or speaking at/ hosting events. 

One strange thing I simply can't live without... my journal... it's right up there with chocolate and coffee. :)

I love to laugh and attempt to get as much joy out of life as possible all while trying to encourage others  around me to do the same. 

I haven't travelled as much as I would like (who has?!) but so far my favourite trip  was Mauii (this is where I fell in love with my husband), with Sweden being a close second (I went to Gotenburg for a friends wedding; it was amazing), and Italy coming in third. 

I sincerely hope you get to see and do everything you have on your bucket list and I look forward to  assisting you with a wonderful place to stay while you are in Vancouver seeing and achieving whatever it is that brings you to the city. 

I look forward to hosting you soon.

284013208,https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/284013208,Mira,2019-08-08,"Vancouver, Canada","A  little about me….
I have been a practicing Art Educator for almost 20 years touring children from grade 1 to 12 at the Vancouver Art Gallery.  This practice allows me to explore art tradition, passion and execution with others in a traditional art gallery setting in a non-constrained open dialogue.  The sharing component of pairing art and education has brought much joy to my life.

The Eastside Culture Crawl Society has provided a greater view of expanding my art knowledge during the more than 10 years I have devoted to the organization.  It has been a pleasure to serve on the Board of the ECCS and Chair for 2 years as well as be the founder of the children's program Studio 101.  Also it was a pleasure to Chair the Space Committee and then continue to serve on that Committee.  It is very exciting to see the ECCS move the artist studio practice forward into becoming Vancouver's Eastside Art District.  What a pleasure it is play a role in that becoming a reality.

Over the last 20 years it has been my passion to personally grow through creating an art collection of local and international talent in the visual art field.  I'd have to say part of the fun of being a “small 'C'” collector, as I refer to myself, is the unexpected things you learn about yourself as you learn about art. As an art collector I love exploring these discoveries with others and sharing stories.

I have been living in Vancouver for 7 years and has been an airbnb host since 2019. I take pride in consistently providing our guests with cozy, comfortable stays that adds to their travel experiences. 

BC is an amazing place where there's an extensive variety of culture and unlimited nature activities. Here you can find authentic, exquisite world cuisine with ease or enjoy a Michelin star meal with creative cocktail. BC is also heaven for adventure seekers like me - hiking, paddle boarding, wakeboarding, kayaking in the summer, ski and snowboarding, snow mobile riding in the winter. A ferry ride away in Vancouver Island, extreme sports lovers can skydive with the stunning view, or grab a dry suit and dive into the kelp forest. 

I am deeply in love with BC, and I hope you will too.

We loved it here!

We found out how much this city and province have to offer and couldn't stop thinking about what a life here would look like.

Well, we made the jump in June of 2018 and kissed Montreal goodbye.

Since then, we spent our time doing what we love. Mountain biking, road cycling, hiking and exploring. Obviously, the little guy follows us in all of our adventures.

Lastly, we enjoy good food, wine, beer and spirits.

My name is Michael, a resident of Vancouver B.C. for the past 30 years. I am the proud father of two young boys and a happy husband. Connecting with new people and exploring different cultures is a passion of mine, which led me to become a full-time Airbnb host.

In my leisure time, I enjoy sports like hockey, snowboarding, basketball, and cycling. I'm a travel enthusiast, and my favorite place in the world is Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, where I was born.

I'm an expert in making pho and have been perfecting my recipe for over 22 years. My loved ones love it and often say it's one of the best pho they've ever had.

I look forward to helping you have a comfortable and memorable stay in this wonderful city. If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to me.

When I first arrived in the Pacific Northwest, it felt like coming home. My husband is a 5th generation Seattleite.  I knew this was the place for my kids to grow and thrive.  For almost 20 years I helped people find their homes here, helping my neighbors and my community preserving the history of their older homes.  

I have a genuine interest in houses, architecture, & construction and an interest to show you the beauty of our area.
 
Since 2000, I managed thousands of furnished rental homes,  If you live here now and want a change, please let us know.
